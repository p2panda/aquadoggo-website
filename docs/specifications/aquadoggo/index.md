title: aquadoggo API
---

[aquadoggo](https://github.com/p2panda/aquadoggo/) is a reference node implementation for p2panda. It is a intended as a tool for making the design and build of local-first, collaborative p2p applications as simple as possible, and hopefully even a little fun!

aquadoggo can run both on your own device for local-first applications, or on a public server when acting as shared community infrastructure. Nodes like aquadoggo perform a number of tasks ranging from core p2panda data replication and validation, aiding the discovery and establishment of connections between edge peers, and exposing a developer friendly API used for building applications.
