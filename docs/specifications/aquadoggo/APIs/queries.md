title: Queries
---

- The GraphQL schema of a node changes depending on the schemas that are available on the node.
- A node inserts additional queryable fields into the root query type for every schema that can be queried.
  - In addition, corresponding types for responses, pagination, ordering and filtering are generated according to the schemas' definitions.
  - Together, these allow clients to request documents including their materialized views and metadata.
  - Detailed descriptions of the generated types and queries follows below.
- Therefore, client implementations SHOULD gracefully handle being connected to a node that doesn't process a schema they would like to interact with.
- This specification defines a generic form for these dynamic GraphQL fields and types.
  - The string `<schema_id>` is used as a generic placeholder to be replaced by a concrete _schema id_.


## `<schema_id>`

- Returns a single document that uses this schema
  - Implementations must have no side effects
- The name of this field is equal to the _schema id_ of the schema it represents
- Either the `id` or `viewId` field argument must be set
  - If `id` contains a document id, the response must contain the [_latest document view_][latest-document-view] for that document
  - If `viewId` contains a document view id, the response must contain this document view
  - If both field arguments are given the view id is used
- Not every node holds all documents and especially not all document views (historical states of a document) in its database because of the decentralised nature of p2panda. in this case a "not found" error will be returned

```graphql
type QueryRoot {
  # ... other query root fields here ...

  <schema_id>(
    # id of the document to be queried
    id: DocumentId

    # specific document view id to be queried
    viewId: DocumentViewId
  ): <schema_id>
}
```

## `all_<schema_id>`

- Returns the [latest document view][latest-document-view] for many documents of a given schema
  - Implementations must have no side effects
- Deleted documents must not be included in the response unless they are explicitly included using a filter
- Response is paginated, can be sorted and filtered

```graphql
type QueryRoot {
  # ... other query root fields here ...

  # Get all <schema_id> documents with pagination, ordering and filtering.
  all_<schema_id>(
    # Filter the query based on field values
    filter: <schema_id>Filter

    # Filter the query based on meta field values
    meta: MetaFilterInput

    # Field by which items in the collection will be ordered
    orderBy: <schema_id>OrderBy

    # Direction which items in the collection will be ordered
    orderDirection: OrderDirection

    # Number of paginated items we want from this request
    first: Int = 25

    # The item we wish to start paginating from identified by a cursor
    after: Cursor
  ): <schema_id>Collection!
}
```

## types

- A node's GraphQL schema contains both statically defined and dynamically created types.
- these types may relate to query arguments for handling filtering, ordering and pagination or types present on query responses.
- dynamically created types always contain the `schema_id` of the schema they are derived from in their name, whereas static types do not.
- for simple values scalar types are used:
  - Document fields with the types `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Float` and `String` are represented with the corresponding GraphQL scalar types.
  - Document fields with the relation types `Relation` / `RelationList` and `PinnedRelation` / `PinnedRelationList` use the type generated for that field's schema.
- the following is a list of all other generated and static types which can be found in a node's root GraphQL schema.

### Scalars

```graphql
# cursor used in paginated queries.
scalar Cursor

# id of a p2panda document.
scalar DocumentId

# document view id of a p2panda document. Refers to a specific point in a documents history
# and can be used to deterministically reconstruct it's state at that time.
scalar DocumentViewId

# signed bamboo entry, encoded as a hexadecimal string.
scalar EncodedEntry

# entry payload and p2panda operation, CBOR bytes encoded as a hexadecimal string.
scalar EncodedOperation

# hash of a signed bamboo entry.
scalar EntryHash

# log id of a bamboo entry.
scalar LogId

# public key that signed the entry.
scalar PublicKey

# sequence number of an entry.
scalar SeqNum

```

### Responses

```graphql
# response from a request for a single <schema_id> document
type <schema_id> {
  # application fields of a `<schema_id>` document.
  fields: <schema_id>Fields

  # meta fields of a `<schema_id>` document.
  meta: DocumentMeta
}

# application fields of a `<schema_id>` document.
type <schema_id>Fields {
  # named fields containing the actual, materialized values of this document view. the form is defined by the regarding p2panda schema
  <field_name>: <field_type>

  # ... potentially more fields
}

# single page response returned when querying a collection of `<schema_id>` documents.
type <schema_id>Collection {
  # total number of documents available in this paginated collection.
  totalCount: Int!

  # cursor for the next page
  endCursor: String!

  # boolean value denoting whether there is a next page available on this query.
  hasNextPage: Boolean!

  # field containing the actual document fields.
  documents: [<schema_id>Item!]!
}

# single item in a paginated collection response
type <schema_id>Item {
  # application fields of a `band` document.
  fields: <schema_id>Fields

  # meta fields of a `band` document.
  meta: DocumentMeta

  # the pagination `cursor` for this `<schema_id>` document.
  cursor: String
}

# Meta fields of a document, contains id and authorship information.
type DocumentMeta {
  # document id of this document.
  documentId: DocumentId!

  # document view id of this document.
  viewId: DocumentViewId!

  # public key of the author who first created this document.
  owner: PublicKey!
}
