In this _Learn_ section we want to introduce you to the concepts around p2panda. It will not be as _formal_ as the [Specification](/specifications) but also more _theoretical_ than the [Tutorials](/tutorials). With all of the other resources together you should get a good overview of what p2panda is about.

If you have never dealt with p2p protocols before it might be helpful to start with the first [Entries](/learn/entries) chapter as it contains basic questions around decentralised systems. If you want to directly jump into p2panda it might be better to start reading the second [Operations](/learn/operations) chapter.
